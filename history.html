<p>JuggleLab has been running since mid-2009, when Christian Parr and Liz
Louden decided to find a spacious new venue for local jugglers to meet.</p>

<p>After four years at Brunswick East Primary School, the club shifted south to 
NICA in August of 2013.</p>

<p>The club is the evolution of JuggleJam, held at Irene's Warehouse in
Brunswick. </p>
