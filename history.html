<p>JuggleLab has been running since mid-2009, when Christian Parr and Liz
Louden decided to find a spacious new venue for local jugglers to meet.</p>

<p>After four years at Brunswick East Primary School, the club shifted south to 
NICA in August of 2013. We moved northside again at the start of 2018,
landing at Blue Circus Studios in Fitzroy, then returned to NICA in 2021 after
Blue closed late in 2020.</p>

<p>The club is the evolution of JuggleJam, held at Irene's Warehouse in
Brunswick. </p>
