<p>The juggling club provides a great space to learn new tricks, pass, practice
routines or just chill out and chat. It's not a structured class - it's really
casual - just drop in whenever you can. It's a great place to meet new people.
We sometimes go to the pub afterwards. </p>

<p>If you're new to juggling, we can help to get you started. If you already
know the basics, there are plenty of people willing to teach you some new
tricks or a new prop. </p>

<p>We provide some basic juggling equipment, such as balls, clubs, diabolos,
rings, devil sticks and poi. Feel free to bring your own equipment. Unicycles
are very welcome. There's also some mats if you're into acrobalance.</p> 

<p>The club is run by volunteers who take no profit from the weekly fee. All
money collected goes towards hire of the hall and public liability
insurance.</p>
